# Dotfiles #

I keep my most important dotfiles in version control so I can access them
from different machines and revert changes to them that aren't working out. I
can't promise that they'll work for you, but they're good enough for my
simple needs.

## Thanks ##

I lifted some of the clever bits from others:

   * [Jeffery Neitzel][1] for KSH functions that I use in my zshrc
   * [Dan Callahan][2] for some handy git aliases.
